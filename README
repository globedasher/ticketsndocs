Tickets 'n Docs is has been built by Richard Morley.
Open source 2016-- I'm still learning about everypart of Software Engineering,
licensing, readme, Git, and everthing else.

The beginning portion is the ticket application. This is simply a help desk
ticketing system that is available for free and the UI will be presented
through a web browser. The ticketing system can be used for any purpose; IT,
Website Updates, Facilities Maintenance, Technical Support, Software Updates,
Hardware Issues, etc. 

The document tracking system has not yet been been created, but the vision is 
create a system that will allow any file to be uploaded to the server. The file
will be stored with a time/date stamp and cannot be overwritten or deleted. 
This will allow for tracking of documents organization wide and prevent loss of
any crucial data.

This system is written in Python 3.5 using Django 1.9 for the web framework.
