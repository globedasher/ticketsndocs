2016.07.13 globedasher - I am going back through the Django tutorial with the
                         aim of creating a Tickets 'n Docs application to 
                         sell.
                         I am currently on the API section of part 2 of the 
                         Djano tutorial.

2016.07.18 globedasher - I am building some pages that aren't quite working
                         yet. I have more to learn about commenting in the 
                         documents. Expecially now I am having to move into 
                         HTML code as well...

                         delsquaredb

Hi Mike,

I added this repository and it's private. Let's get cracking!

to run the applicaiton, I suggest you install a virtualenvironment as 
env in the root folder. From the main TND folder, you will need to run
python manage.py runserver to run the testserver and view it with your
web browser at 127.0.0.1:8000/tickets and /admin. I don't think you'll 
need any other setup.

To learn more about how this works, go through the "build your first
Django app" eight part tutorial at the official Django page.

Let me know if you have any questions.
