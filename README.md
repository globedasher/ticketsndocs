Tickets 'n Docs is has been built by Richard Morley.

Open source 2016-- I'm still learning about every part of Software Engineering,
licensing, readme, Git, and everthing else.

The beginning portion is the ticket application. This is simply a help desk
ticketing system that is available for free and the UI will be presented
through a web browser. The ticketing system can be used for any purpose; IT,
Website Updates, Facilities Maintenance, Technical Support, Software Updates,
Hardware Issues, etc. 

As of 2016.24.08, I have the basic functions of the tickets application 
completed. This application will accept new tickets and display those tickets
which have been created. Features to come: the tickets will have additional 
fields to indicate if the issue is confirmed and further, a close date will be
added and the tickets will no longer be displayed on the currently open ticket
list once the closed date has been entered by a user. And much more to come. 

The document tracking system has not yet been been created, but the vision is 
create a system that will allow any file to be uploaded to the server. The file
will be stored with a time/date stamp and cannot be overwritten or deleted. 
This will allow for tracking of documents organization wide and prevent loss of
any crucial data.

This system is written in Python 3.5 using Django 1.9 for the web framework.
